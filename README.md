#
### Getting Started
1\. First of all you need to clone E Space repository from github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/giorgi-zanqaidze-movie-quotes
```

2\. Next step requires you to run *composer install* in order to install all the dependencies.
```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```
in order to build your JS/SaaS resources.

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#
**MYSQL:**
>DB_CONNECTION=mysql

>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

>DB_PORT=3306

>DB_DATABASE=*****

>DB_USERNAME=*****

>DB_PASSWORD=*****

##### Now, you should be good to go!


#
### Migration
if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

#
### Running Unit tests
Running unit tests also is very simple process, just type in following command:

```sh
composer test
```

#
### Development

You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```sh
  php artisan serve
```

when working on JS you may run:

```sh
  npm run dev
```
it builds your js files into executable scripts.
If you want to watch files during development, execute instead:

```sh
  npm run watch
```
it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.

### Project Structure

```bash
├─── app
│   ├─── Console
│   ├─── Exceptions
│   ├─── Http
│   ├─── Providers
│   │___ Rules
│   │... Models
├─── bootstrap
├─── config
├─── database
├─── node-modules
├─── packages
├─── public
├─── resources
├─── routes
├─── scripts
├─── storage
- .env
- artisan
- composer.json
- package.json
```

Project structure is fairly straitforward(at least for laravel developers)...
